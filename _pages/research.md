## Research Focus

This project investigates the relationship between:

- Voice and participation in decision processes
- Perceived strategic alignment
- Organizational certainty
- Strategic decision-making under complexity

The central objective is to distinguish perceived alignment from surface agreement and apparent consensus.

## Problem space

Strategic decisions often produce visible agreement while leaving underlying interpretations fragmented. This project studies how **voice dynamics** shape the emergence of **perceived alignment** around strategic decisions—especially under uncertainty.

## Key distinctions

### Alignment vs. agreement
Alignment refers to perceived coherence between strategy, priorities, and action. Agreement can occur without alignment, including cases of surface compliance or apparent consensus.

### Voice vs. formal participation
Voice is not reduced to formal participation mechanisms. It includes discretionary expression, how it is received, and how meaning is negotiated in decision contexts.

## Conceptual framework (high level)

The project examines a dynamic chain:

**Strategic decision context → voice dynamics → interpretative processes → perceived alignment → downstream outcomes**

This framework is tested using quantitative modelling and deepened through qualitative follow-up.
