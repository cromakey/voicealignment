## Doctoral Research Project

**Investigating Voice, Perceived Alignment and Strategic Decision-Making in Contemporary Organizations**

This website presents an ongoing doctoral research project focused on how organizational members interpret strategic decisions, how perceived alignment emerges, and how voice dynamics shape decision processes.

The project examines alignment as a perceptual and interpretative construct rather than a purely structural outcome.
