## Doctoral Research Project

**Investigating Voice, Perceived Alignment and Strategic Decision-Making in Contemporary Organizations**

This website presents an ongoing doctoral research project focused on how organizational members interpret strategic decisions, how perceived alignment emerges, and how voice dynamics shape decision processes.

The project examines alignment as a perceptual and interpretative construct rather than a purely structural outcome.

Use the navigation menu to explore the conceptual framework, research design, and future outputs.

## Research questions

- How do organizational members construct and update **perceptions of strategic alignment** in decision contexts?
- Under which conditions does **voice** contribute to alignment versus surface agreement?
- How does **organizational certainty/uncertainty** shape voice dynamics around strategic decisions?

## Conceptual anchors

- Alignment is treated as a **perceptual and interpretative construct**, not merely a structural outcome.
- Voice is approached as a **dynamic process** (expression, reception, sensemaking, and consequences).
- Strategic decisions are analysed as **socially embedded events** occurring under ambiguity, power, and competing interpretations.
- The project explicitly distinguishes **alignment** from **apparent/illusory consensus**.
- The focus is on contemporary organizational contexts where complexity and change are persistent.

## Collaboration with participating organizations

Organizations participating in the research can expect:

- A clear participation protocol and minimal operational burden.
- Strict confidentiality and reporting at an **aggregated level**.
- A concise feedback document summarizing **patterns and insights** relevant to decision processes and alignment perceptions.
- No commercial services are offered through this website; this is an academic research project.
