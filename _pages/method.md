## Research Design

The project adopts a sequential mixed-method approach (QUAN → QUAL).

### Quantitative Phase
- Psychometric validation
- Latent profile analysis
- Moderation modelling

### Qualitative Phase
- Interpretative exploration of decision processes
- Contextualization of alignment perceptions

Data are analysed at an aggregated level.
