## Overview

This doctoral project adopts a **sequential mixed-method** design (QUAN → QUAL), combining quantitative modelling with qualitative follow-up to interpret patterns in context.

## Quantitative phase

### What is modelled
- Measurement quality and construct validity (e.g., CFA)
- Person-centred patterns (e.g., latent profile analysis)
- Conditional effects (e.g., moderation / interaction models)

### What is reported
- Psychometric evidence (reliability and validity)
- Profile solutions and interpretability
- Robustness checks and model transparency

## Qualitative phase

The qualitative component explores how organizational members interpret strategic decisions, make sense of uncertainty, and evaluate whether “alignment” is genuine or merely apparent.

## Ethics and data protection

- Participation is voluntary.
- Data are handled confidentially and analysed at aggregated levels.
- No individual or organization is identifiable in public outputs.
